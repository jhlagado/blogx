# Preface: A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy by Karl Marx 1859

By John Hardy

## Overview and Historical Context

Marx argues that legal and political systems don't develop independently; they arise from the material conditions of production (the economic base). Economic structures determine the political and ideological superstructure, not vice versa. He traces how different modes of production (tribal, ancient, feudal, capitalist) create different social relations and class structures. The contradictions between productive forces and relations of production eventually trigger social revolution and transformation.

By 1859, Marx had already written the *Communist Manifesto* with Engels in 1848, and he'd been developing his ideas for about fifteen years since then. The *Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy*, however, represents his first major attempt to systematically present his materialist method in a substantial economic work.

*Das Kapital* (Volume 1) won't be published until 1867, eight years *after* this preface. So this 1859 work is Marx preparing the ground, laying out his methodology and analytical framework before the full three-volume *Capital* arrives.

In the preface itself, Marx mentions that his economic studies were interrupted by the 1848 Revolution and various political upheavals. He only resumed serious economic work in London around 1850, drawing on the vast material in the British Museum. By 1859, he's consolidating all that research into this *Contribution*.

**Chronology:** *Communist Manifesto* (1848) → scattered writings and interruptions (1848-1850) → resumed economic study in London (1850s) → *Contribution to the Critique* (1859) → *Das Kapital* Volume 1 (1867).

This 1859 preface is the bridge between his earlier political writings and his mature economic analysis.

## Marx's Materialist Method

Marx's preface outlines his materialist approach to political economy. He explains that he studies society by examining how the mode of production (the way goods are made and distributed) shapes everything else: law, politics, ideology, consciousness.

His core argument: economic structures form the foundation; political and legal systems build on top of that foundation. When productive forces develop and clash with existing property relations, social revolution happens. He traces this through history (tribal, ancient, feudal, capitalist modes of production), each creating its own class structures and contradictions.

Marx emphasizes that you can't understand a historical period by its ideology or what people *think* about themselves. You have to look at the material conditions and class conflicts underneath.

## The Structure of His Analysis

Marx opens by outlining his plan: examine bourgeois economy in a specific order (capital, landed property, wage-labour, the State, foreign trade, and world market), analysing the economic conditions of the three great classes of modern bourgeois society.

All this material exists as scattered monographs written over time for self-clarification, not publication. Reorganizing them into an integrated whole depends on circumstances.

## Methodological Approach: From Particular to General

Marx originally drafted a general introduction but decided to omit it. Anticipating results before proving them would confuse readers. Anyone who wants to follow his analysis must move from the particular to the general, building up from specific cases to broader conclusions, not starting with abstract generalizations. 

This is a deliberate methodological choice: start concrete, build toward theory, avoiding the imposition of theory from above. This approach distinguishes Marx's empirical materialism from abstract idealist philosophy.

## Marx's Intellectual Journey

Marx offers brief remarks about his own study of political economy. Although he studied law, he always treated it as subordinate to philosophy and history.

In 1842-43, as editor of the Rheinische Zeitung, he found himself forced to discuss "material interests": debates about forest thefts, land division, and peasant conditions. These practical economic questions pulled him into studying political economy.

At that time, French socialism and communism were circulating in intellectual circles, often based on good intentions without factual knowledge. Marx criticized this dilettantism but admitted his own knowledge was insufficient to evaluate French socialist theories properly.

When the newspaper faced suppression, he withdrew to his study to deepen his understanding of these economic questions. His turn toward political economy came from *practical necessity*, encountering real economic conflicts, not from abstract theorizing. This biographical detail is crucial: Marx's theory emerged from engagement with actual material struggles, not from armchair speculation.

## The Critique of Hegel

Marx describes his first major work: a critical re-examination of Hegelian philosophy of law. From this inquiry, he reached a crucial conclusion: legal and political forms cannot be understood by themselves or through abstract ideas about human development.

Instead, they originate in the material conditions of life, what Hegel called "civil society." Understanding civil society requires studying political economy. That's where the real foundation lies. 

Analysing law and politics in isolation misses the point. You have to go deeper, to the economic base that generates those legal and political forms. This represents Marx's fundamental break with Hegelian idealism while retaining Hegel's dialectical method.

Marx studied political economy first in Paris, then Brussels (after being expelled by the French government). From these studies, he arrived at what became his guiding principle for all his work.

## The Core Principle: Base and Superstructure

In social production, people inevitably enter into definite relations of production that are independent of their will. These relations of production constitute the economic structure of society, the real foundation. On top of this foundation rises a legal and political superstructure, with corresponding forms of social consciousness.

The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social, political, and intellectual life. **It's not people's consciousness that determines their existence; it's their social existence that determines their consciousness.**

This formulation inverts the idealist conception dominant in philosophy. Rather than ideas shaping material reality, material reality shapes ideas. Consciousness is determined by being, not the reverse.

At certain stages of development, the material productive forces come into conflict with existing relations of production. When this happens, these relations transform from forms of development into fetters on development. Then social revolution begins.

Changes in the economic foundation eventually transform the entire superstructure. Economy is base, politics and ideology are superstructure, and contradictions in the economic base drive historical change.

## Analysing Social Transformation

When studying transformations of society, Marx distinguishes between two things:

**First,** the material transformation of economic conditions of production, which can be determined with scientific precision, like natural science.

**Second,** the ideological forms (legal, political, religious, artistic, philosophical) through which people become conscious of conflicts and fight them out.

His key point: don't judge a period of transformation by its consciousness or ideology. Instead, explain that consciousness *from* the material contradictions, from the actual conflict between productive forces and relations of production.

Just as you can't judge an individual by what he thinks about himself, you can't judge a historical period by what people think about it. You have to look at the material conflicts underneath.

**No social order is destroyed before its productive forces are fully developed.** New relations of production only replace old ones when the material conditions for change have already matured within the old system. 

This principle has profound implications: it suggests that revolutionary transformation isn't merely a matter of will or consciousness, but requires objective material conditions. You cannot simply "think" your way to a new mode of production; the contradictions must ripen within the existing system.

## Historical Progression of Modes of Production

Marx discusses the progression of modes of production through history. In broad outline, distinct epochs emerge: the Asiatic, ancient, feudal, and modern bourgeois modes of production. Each marks progress in economic development.

A crucial claim follows: **the bourgeois mode of production is the last antagonistic form of social production**, antagonistic in ways rooted in individuals' social conditions of existence, beyond mere personal conflict. However, the productive forces developing *within* bourgeois society create the material conditions for resolving this antagonism. 

Prehistory closes with the bourgeois formation, the final class-based system before a new stage emerges. This represents Marx's teleological vision: capitalism contains within itself the seeds of its own transcendence.

## Collaboration with Engels

Marx brings in Frederick Engels, explaining how they arrived at the same conclusions through different routes and decided to collaborate on setting forth their conception against German philosophy.

Marx and Engels decided to critique post-Hegelian philosophy and settle accounts with their "former philosophical conscience." They wrote this as a manuscript called *The German Ideology*, two large volumes that reached publishers in Westphalia but couldn't be printed due to changed circumstances.

Marx abandoned the manuscript willingly to "the gnawing criticism of the mice" because they'd already achieved their main purpose: **self-clarification**. The intellectual work was done; publication was secondary. This reveals Marx's primary motivation: understanding reality, not merely publicizing doctrine.

The scattered works they published publicly at that time include the *Manifesto of the Communist Party* (co-written with Engels), *Discourse on Free Trade*, and *The Misery of Philosophy* (Marx's 1847 polemical attack on Proudhon, which presented their conception in academic form).

Publication of a work on wage-labour was interrupted by the February Revolution of 1848 and Marx's forced removal from Belgium. Their ideas developed through collaborative work, practical political engagement, and intellectual struggle, not in isolation.

## Return to Economic Study in London

The 1848-49 revolutions and subsequent events cut short Marx's economic studies. Serious work only resumed in London in 1850.

Three things drew him back to intensive study:

1. The British Museum's vast collection of materials on the history of political economy
2. London's position as an ideal vantage point to observe bourgeois society directly
3. Major economic developments, particularly the gold discoveries in California and Australia, which suggested capitalism was entering a new stage

Marx started from scratch again, working carefully through new material. This led him into apparently remote subjects requiring substantial time. More pressingly, he had to earn a living. 

An eight-year collaboration with the New York Tribune, a leading Anglo-American newspaper, fragmented his studies. Much of his work consisted of articles analysing major economic events in Britain and Europe, forcing him to master practical economic details beyond strictly theoretical political economy.

This journalistic work, while interrupting his systematic research, also grounded his analysis in concrete economic phenomena. Marx wasn't merely theorizing about capitalism; he was tracking its actual movements in real time.

## Conclusion: Conscientious Research, Not Ideology

Marx concludes that this sketch of his study shows his views are the outcome of conscientious research over many years, not prejudiced ideology, despite how ruling classes might judge them. 

He ends with a Dante quote about leaving suspicion and cowardice behind at the entrance to science, suggesting that rigorous inquiry requires courage and intellectual honesty, not preconceived conclusions.

This preface establishes the methodological foundation for all Marx's subsequent economic work. It presents historical materialism as a research program, grounded in empirical investigation of how human societies produce and reproduce their material existence, rejecting rigid dogma. The base-superstructure model, the theory of historical stages, and the concept of social revolution through internal contradictions all emerge from this foundational text, shaping Marx's own work and generations of social and economic analysis that followed.
