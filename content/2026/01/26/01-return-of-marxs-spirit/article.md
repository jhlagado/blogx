# The Spectre Returns: Derrida's Critique of the "End of History" and the Rehabilitation of Marxist Spirit

## Introduction: A Spectre Is Haunting the 1990s

In 1993, Jacques Derrida delivered a series of lectures at the University of California, Riverside that would become *Spectres of Marx: The State of the Debt, the Work of Mourning and the New International*. The timing was no accident. The Berlin Wall had fallen in 1989, the Soviet Union had collapsed in 1991, and Francis Fukuyama had proclaimed "the end of history" in a triumphant celebration of liberal capitalism's supposed final victory. Marxism, it seemed, was dead, a failed experiment consigned to history's dustbin.

Yet Derrida opened his lectures with a defiant observation: a spectre was haunting the entire world, beyond Europe alone, and that spectre was Marx. This spectre, far from being exorcised by liberal capitalism's declarations of victory, was returning with renewed urgency precisely at the moment of its supposed elimination. The attempt to kill the ghost of Marx through triumphalist proclamation had failed, and what was repressed was coming back to haunt those who most vehemently denied its presence.

This article examines Derrida's sophisticated intervention in the debates of the early 1990s. Through close analysis of his critique of Fukuyama's "end of history" thesis and Alexandre Kojève's concept of post-history, his careful distinction between the "spirit" of Marxist critique and Marxist dogmatism, his devastating diagnosis of ten interconnected global crises, and his proposal of a "New International" as an adequate form of contemporary solidarity, we can trace Derrida's attempt to think what it means to remain faithful to Marx without being a Marxist, to preserve the emancipatory promise while rejecting teleological certainty.

## Part I: The Ideological Function of "End of History" Thinking

### Fukuyama's Paradoxical Ideal

Francis Fukuyama's *The End of History and the Last Man* (1992) claimed that liberal capitalism and Western parliamentary democracy represented the final stage of human political development. Drawing on Alexandre Kojève's Hegelian-Marxist interpretation of history, Fukuyama argued that with the collapse of Soviet communism, humanity had reached its political terminus. History, understood as the struggle for recognition and the evolution of political forms, was effectively over.

Derrida identifies a fundamental paradox at the heart of Fukuyama's thesis. The ideal Fukuyama proposes is simultaneously infinite and finite: infinite because it remains distinguished from any empirical reality and persists as a tendency "in the long run," yet finite because it has supposedly "already happened" as an ideal, meaning history is concluded. This contradictory structure allows Fukuyama to claim that history has ended while simultaneously acknowledging that the liberal democratic ideal has not been fully realised, a sleight of hand that immunises the thesis against empirical falsification.

When confronted with massive inequality, violence, or injustice in actually existing liberal democracies, Fukuyama can retreat to the claim that these are merely failures to achieve the ideal, not evidence against the ideal itself. Conversely, when pointing to capitalism's "victory" over communism, he can invoke empirical events as proof of historical inevitability. The argument shifts opportunistically between empirical and transcendental registers, never remaining still long enough to be refuted.

### The Unexamined Foundation: "Man as Man"

Beneath this methodological sleight of hand lies an even more troubling foundation: Fukuyama's reliance on an utterly unexamined concept of "man as man" or "natural man" as a trans-historical standard for measuring historical progress. Fukuyama claims that we cannot speak meaningfully about history without reference to a "permanent, trans-historical standard" grounded in nature itself.

Derrida observes with barely concealed astonishment that Fukuyama appears completely oblivious to centuries of philosophical critique of such universal abstractions. Marx himself, in *The German Ideology*, excoriated Max Stirner for invoking the "ghostly abstraction" of Man as such. Nietzsche demolished the concept of universal human nature. Freud complicated any notion of human dignity by revealing the unconscious drives that structure subjectivity. Heidegger fundamentally questioned the nature of being itself. Even Hegel (whom Fukuyama claims as his philosophical ancestor) was decidedly not a philosopher of natural or trans-historical man.

The irony is acute: Fukuyama invokes Hegel while ignoring everything that makes Hegel philosophically significant. When pressed to define his trans-historical standard, Fukuyama appeals to "the first man" or "natural man," concepts whose genealogy he never interrogates. He even invokes a synthetic construction he calls "Hegel-Kojève," a purely artificial philosophical hybrid so inconsistent and insubstantial that Derrida dismisses it as a mere "symptomatic montage" designed to reassure anxious audiences, never to think seriously.

### Why This Book? The Psychology of Disavowal

Derrida poses a crucial question: Why has this philosophically naive book achieved such prominence? Why has it become a "media gadget" consumed in "the ideological supermarkets of a worried West"?

The answer lies in its ideological function, never in the book's intellectual rigor. Fukuyama's text provides reassurance through what psychoanalysis would call "manic disavowal." At precisely the moment when liberal capitalism's actual state is most critical, fragile, and threatened, even catastrophic, triumphalist declarations of its final victory proliferate. The media amplification of the "end of history" narrative reveals anxiety and the desperate need to suppress what everyone half-knows, never confidence or security.

What must be suppressed is the persistent relevance of what Derrida calls "the spirit of Marxist critique." If this critique were truly dead and irrelevant, there would be no need for constant exorcism. The very insistence that "Marxism is finished" betrays the fear that it retains the power to articulate what liberal ideology cannot acknowledge about its own failures and contradictions.

In Freudian terms, Fukuyama's text performs unsuccessful mourning work. It cannot genuinely put to rest what it claims to have buried, so it resorts to jubilatory, manic assertions that betray the repressed anxiety underneath. The spectre returns precisely because the attempt to kill it through declaration alone can never succeed.

## Part II: The Spirit of Marxism vs. Marxist Systems

### A Crucial Distinction

Derrida's most important theoretical move is to carefully distinguish between four things that are often conflated: first, Marxism as ontology or metaphysical system (dialectical materialism, the claim that matter is fundamental and history unfolds through dialectical laws); second, Marxism as historical method (the reduction of all history to economic base and ideological superstructure); third, Marxism as institutional apparatus (the party, the State, the International, the dictatorship of the proletariat); and fourth, the spirit of Marxist critique (the capacity for radical self-interrogation and emancipatory thinking).

The first three, Derrida argues, must be rejected or at least radically questioned. Marxist ontology shares with liberal ideology the same onto-theo-teleological structure: the assumption that being, divine order, and predetermined end form an intelligible totality. This structure "locks up, neutralizes, and finally cancels historicity" by converting the radically open future into a predetermined destination.

Similarly, Marxist apparatuses (the vanguard party, the single-party state, the totalitarian machinery that claimed to represent workers) have failed in ways that revealed something problematic in the very structure of Marxist thought. The move from critique to organisation, from theory to practice, was inherent in how Marxism constituted itself as a systematic doctrine claiming access to historical truth, never an external corruption.

Yet the fourth element, the spirit of Marxist critique, remains "more indispensable than ever." This spirit consists of two essential components that must be preserved:

**First, the principle of radical and interminable critique.** Marx's greatest contribution was a method of questioning that was willing to challenge fundamental assumptions others took for granted, never a closed system. This critique was radical (questioning entire structures, not just surface symptoms), self-critical (subjecting its own assumptions to constant revision), and open to transformation (learning from historical changes and adapting accordingly).

**Second, the emancipatory and messianic affirmation.** Beyond mere critique, Marx carried a promise of liberation: the conviction that another world beyond domination and exploitation is both necessary and possible. This promise is valuable precisely as promise, as an opening to a future that cannot be predetermined. Once it becomes a specific program (the dictatorship of the proletariat, the communist society as determinate form), it closes off the very openness that makes emancipation genuinely possible.

### The Messianic Without Messianism

Derrida introduces a crucial conceptual innovation: the distinction between messianism and the messianic structure.

**Messianism** is any specific doctrine about how history will end, whether religious (Christ will return), Marxist (the proletariat will triumph), or liberal (democracy and free markets will prevail). Messianism knows in advance what the future will bring and claims access to the path that leads there.

**The messianic structure**, by contrast, is the formal necessity of promise, hope, and obligation without predetermined content. It is the recognition that we are always already oriented toward a future we cannot calculate or control, that responsibility and decision address us even when we lack guarantees about outcomes.

This distinction allows Derrida to preserve what is most valuable in Marx (the emancipatory impulse, the conviction that justice demands radical transformation, the openness to an incalculable future) while rejecting the dogmatism and teleological certainty that have plagued Marxist movements. We can affirm that another world is necessary without claiming to know what that world will look like. We can work for emancipation without believing that historical laws guarantee its achievement. We can maintain hope without succumbing to utopian fantasy.

### Why This Spirit Is Indispensable Now

The contemporary moment, the moment of Fukuyama's "end of history," is precisely when we most need the spirit of Marxist critique. When liberalism and capitalism have become hegemonic, when the dominant ideology insists there is no alternative, when the future itself seems foreclosed by the claim that we have reached history's terminus, the Marxist spirit resists this closure.

It maintains the conviction that the current arrangement is contingent, never inevitable, and therefore transformable. It insists that critique of existing conditions remains possible and necessary. It affirms that justice demands we imagine and work toward different social arrangements. This sober recognition that any system appearing natural and eternal is in fact historical and contingent has nothing to do with romantic utopianism.

Moreover, liberalism must continually attempt to foreclose Marxist critique, to declare it dead, refuted, obsolete, precisely because it cannot actually refute it. If Marxist critique were genuinely superseded, liberalism would not need to keep exorcising it. The repetitive insistence that "Marxism is dead" reveals that it remains a threat to liberal self-understanding, a spectre that haunts precisely those who deny its presence most vehemently.

## Part III: Kojève's Paradox and the Spectre's Resistance to Ontology

### The Genealogy of Post-History

To understand Fukuyama, one must understand his philosophical ancestor: Alexandre Kojève, whose neo-Marxist and quasi-Heideggerian reading of Hegel's *Phenomenology of Spirit* shaped an entire generation of French intellectuals in the mid-20th century. Kojève's famous "Note" and "Postscript" on post-history claimed that the United States had already achieved "the final stage of Marxist communism" in the post-World War II period.

How could America represent communism's culmination? Kojève argued that American consumer abundance had eliminated the scarcity that historically drove social struggle. When material needs are satisfied without excessive labor, when "all members of a 'classless society' can appropriate whatever they like without having to work more than they wish to," the motor of historical development stops. Desire and need coincide, struggle ceases, and history, understood as the conflict-driven evolution of social forms, comes to an end.

This achievement, according to Kojève, represents something troubling: the reduction of humanity to animality. When material needs are satisfied and recognition struggles cease, human beings lose what made them distinctively human. Post-historical America, in Kojève's provocative formulation, represents a fall back into animal contentment, never the fulfilment of human potential.

### The 1959 Revision and the Instability of the Thesis

Then something unexpected occurred. In 1959, Kojève visited Japan as a European Community official and returned with a radical revision. Japan, he now claimed, had surpassed America in achieving post-history through what he called "snobism in the pure state," the maintenance of cultural refinement and aesthetic formalism that saves post-historical man from mere animality.

Derrida notes with amusement the "French specialty" of returning from brief trips to foreign lands whose languages one doesn't speak and making peremptory universal judgments. Beyond the methodological absurdity lies a deeper revelation: the "end of history" thesis cannot hold its determinate form. Between 1946 and 1959, Kojève shifts the location of post-history's achievement, revealing that the thesis is a framework that precedes and shapes what gets observed, never grounded in careful observation.

More importantly, Kojève does not abandon his diagnosis of America when he adds Japan. Both represent post-history, merely through different paths. This proliferation reveals the essential instability of any attempt to declare history conclusively finished.

### The Enigmatic "Doit": When Prescription Reopens the Future

Derrida identifies something extraordinary that both Kojève and Fukuyama miss: the most important sentence in Kojève's entire postscript. At the very moment of declaring history ended, Kojève writes a prescriptive utterance: "Posthistorical man doit [must/should] continue to detach 'forms' from their 'contents'..."

This single word, *doit*, contains within itself a paradox that undoes the entire thesis. The French "doit" can mean either "must" (logical necessity) or "should" (moral obligation), and the text leaves this indeterminate. Either way, the prescriptive structure points to futurity, obligation, and task. Even post-historical man has something he must do, some responsibility that addresses him, some future orientation that exceeds mere animal contentment.

Derrida's analysis is profound: "Whatever the promise promises, whether it be fulfilled or not, or whether it be unfulfillable, there is necessarily some promise and therefore some historicity as future-to-come." The very attempt to declare history finished inscribes within the declaration the reopening of historical time.

This reveals the fundamental impossibility of binding the spectre to ontology. The spectre (understood as the incalculable promise, the indeterminate obligation, the future that cannot be mastered) resists every attempt to make it determinate. Even Kojève, attempting to specify what post-historical man is and does, must appeal to a prescriptive structure that reopens the future his thesis claims to have closed.

The lesson is crucial: the future cannot be foreclosed. Obligation, duty, and historicity return despite every attempt to eliminate them. The spectre persists because it is structurally unkillable, because it is the very openness of time itself.

## Part IV: The Blackboard Picture: Ten Plagues of Global Capitalism

### "The World Wears as It Grows"

Having established the theoretical inadequacy of "end of history" thinking and the persistent necessity of Marxist critique, Derrida turns to concrete diagnosis. Drawing on Shakespeare's *Timon of Athens* ("How goes the world? It wears, sir, as it grows"), he proposes to paint a "blackboard picture" of what is going catastrophically wrong in the contemporary world.

The image is striking: the world deteriorates precisely in its expansion, wears out precisely as it grows. This directly contradicts both Fukuyama's triumphalism and Kojève's post-historical contentment. The globalisation of capitalism is producing intensification of multiple interconnected crises, never universal prosperity and peace.

Derrida is careful to distinguish the current situation from conventional categories. This is not a "crisis" (implying temporary disorder that will resolve), not "maturation" (suggesting natural development toward fulfillment), not "agony" (implying narrative closure through death). Something else is happening, something that "strikes a blow at the teleological order of history" itself. The situation is post-categorical, escaping the frameworks through which we normally understand historical change.

### The Crisis of Democracy and Public Space

Before enumerating specific plagues, Derrida identifies a fundamental transformation in the very structure of democratic politics. Liberal parliamentary democracy, he argues, has never been in greater dysfunction or occupied a more minority position globally.

The problem extends beyond the familiar distortions of money in politics. Techno-tele-media apparatuses have fundamentally transformed what counts as "public space." The presumption that there is a stable, identifiable location where public discourse occurs (the parliament, the town square, the newspaper) has been shattered. The public is now deterritorialized, existing nowhere and everywhere simultaneously, shaped by media algorithms and corporate interests, not deliberative reason.

This produces a paradox: traditional politicians become structurally incompetent despite their personal abilities. Media power simultaneously strips them of actual political authority (the power they held in parliamentary and party structures) while forcing them into spectacular performances for television cameras. As Derrida puts it: "They were thought to be actors of politics, they now often risk being no more than actors": performers without substance, spectacles without power.

### The Ten Plagues

Derrida identifies ten specific, interconnected problems that characterize what he sardonically calls "the new world order":

**1. Unemployment and the Deregulation of Labor**

The "new unemployment" no longer resembles classical unemployment. Through systemic deregulation, the transformation of work into precarious tele-work, and the collapse of distinctions between labor and non-labor, a new form of suffering emerges that lacks adequate language to articulate itself. This deregulation is "at once mastered, calculated, 'socialized' (that is, most often disavowed), and irreducible to prediction." Capitalism knows it is creating mass insecurity but treats this as an acceptable cost of profit maximisation.

**2. Massive Exclusion of the Homeless and Stateless**

Within wealthy democracies, growing populations lack property, stable addresses, or the ability to participate in "normal" democratic life. Simultaneously, vast numbers are expelled as refugees, immigrants, and stateless persons. This signals a fundamental transformation: liberal democracy depends structurally on populations it systematically excludes. The new experience of borders and identity reveals that citizenship and belonging are mechanisms of exclusion, never universal categories.

**3. Ruthless Economic War**

Rather than harmonious free trade, global capitalism unleashes destructive competition between nations (US, Europe, Japan), within regions (European nations against each other), and between global North and South. Crucially, this economic war "controls everything, beginning with the other wars," because it determines how international law gets interpreted and applied. Military and political conflicts are settled according to economic interests of powerful states.

**4. The Inability to Master Free Market Contradictions**

Free market ideology claims that markets operate by natural laws, yet states constantly intervene through tariffs, subsidies, and protectionist measures. Wealthy nations shield their workers and industries while proclaiming devotion to free trade. The contradiction is irresolvable: one cannot simultaneously pursue competitive advantage in global markets and protect domestic "social advantages." The free market is a myth serving to justify exploitation while denying responsibility for consequences.

**5. Foreign Debt and Structural Exclusion**

Through debt mechanisms, entire nations are impoverished, populations driven to despair, and vast regions excluded from economic participation. The paradox: the logic seeking to extend markets worldwide simultaneously creates exclusion from those markets. Those too poor to consume become economically invisible, suffering the consequences of a system that has no use for them.

**6. The Arms Industry and Permanent War Economy**

Weapons manufacturing is structurally integrated into Western capitalism. Major corporations, employment systems, and investment patterns depend on arms production. The global arms trade exceeds drug trafficking and is often inseparable from it. Short of unimaginable revolution, the arms industry cannot be suspended without economic catastrophe. Peace becomes economically impossible: maintaining employment requires manufacturing weapons that require wars to consume them.

**7. The Uncontrollable Spread of Nuclear Weapons**

Nuclear proliferation now exceeds state control. The countries preaching non-proliferation are the greatest proliferators. Once nuclear technology exists, it cannot be un-invented or monopolized. The spectre of nuclear annihilation haunts all politics, yet no authority can contain it. International institutions prove impotent before the logic of mutual assured destruction.

**8. Inter-Ethnic Wars Driven by Archaic Phantasms**

Nationalist, ethnic, and religious violence proliferates precisely in the age of supposed globalisation. These wars are driven by archaic concepts (nation-state, sovereignty, blood purity, native soil) that should be obsolete in the era of electronic communication and transnational capital. Yet nationalism intensifies, refusing to dissolve. Derrida introduces the concept of "ontopology," the binding of identity and being to stable locality. Technology enables communication transcending location, yet this very dis-location generates frantic attempts to reassert territorial identity.

**9. The Phantom-States: Mafia and Drug Cartels**

Criminal networks operate with state-like power (controlling territory, enforcing rules, extracting resources) without formal state status. These "phantom-States" have infiltrated economic structures, financial systems, and state institutions themselves to the point where they are often indistinguishable from legitimate states. Paradoxically, they sometimes operate more efficiently than bureaucratic states, adapting rapidly to market conditions. Their symbiosis with democratic development (historical ties between Sicilian mafia and Allied forces, for instance) reveals that the line between organised crime and legitimate state apparatus has always been unstable.

**10. The Crisis of International Law**

Despite formal universality and genuine progress, international institutions suffer from two fatal limits. First, their norms depend on specific European philosophical concepts, particularly state sovereignty, whose historical limits are increasingly evident. Second, they are dominated in practice by powerful states that determine interpretation and application. International law remains formally universal while substantively particular, claiming to represent all humanity while serving the strongest military and economic powers. UN resolutions are enforced selectively, human rights rhetoric justifies military intervention, and powerful states remain exempt from accountability.

### The Scale of the Catastrophe

Derrida makes an astonishing claim: "Never have violence, inequality, exclusion, famine, and thus economic oppression affected as many human beings in the history of the earth and humanity."

In absolute numbers, more humans suffer violence, exploitation, and exclusion now than at any previous moment. Yet this massive catastrophe is hidden, denied, celebrated as progress. Fukuyama sings liberal capitalism's triumph while unprecedented human suffering expands. The discourse of human rights becomes obscene when deployed to justify violence and exclude populations. No degree of progress in some regions excuses the expansion of poverty and violence in others.

Derrida also notes a question he must provisionally defer: "What is becoming of animal life in this history?" He acknowledges this as "indissociable" from questions of human justice and emancipation, recognizing that the logic of domination cannot be limited to human relations alone. The question haunts the text as a spectre requiring future attention.

## Part V: The "New International" as Response

### Beyond Classical Forms of Organization

In the face of these interconnected catastrophes, what response is adequate? Derrida proposes the concept of a "New International" as a necessary form of solidarity and critique, never as a solution or program.

This "New International" is explicitly not a revival of classical internationalism. The workers' International, in its various historical forms, operated through party structures, state power, and class essentialism. These forms have collapsed or proven catastrophic. The very concept of the working class as unified revolutionary subject has become problematic as capitalism has transformed labor beyond recognition.

Yet Derrida insists: rejecting classical forms does not mean abandoning organization and effective action. "It is exactly the contrary that matters to us here." The task is to think new forms of organization that do not reproduce the logic of domination they oppose.

### Characteristics of the "New International"

Derrida describes this emerging formation as "a link of affinity, suffering, and hope, a still discreet, almost secret link, as it was around 1848, but more and more visible." It operates without status (no official recognition in international law), without title (cannot be named in conventional political terminology), without name (exceeds any single denomination), barely public (between public and clandestine), without contract (no formal agreement constitutes membership), "out of joint" (untimely, dislocated from conventional political time), without coordination (no central command or unified strategy), without party (transcends party structures and discipline), without country (genuinely international, across and beyond nations), without national community (refuses containment within national boundaries), without co-citizenship (members need not be citizens of any particular state), and without common belonging to a class (unites across class lines).

This structural necessity should never be mistaken for organisational weakness. The "New International" must be "a kind of counter-conjuration," a counter-spell against the attempt to exorcise Marx's spectre. Where liberal ideology attempts to foreclose critique, the "New International" keeps critique alive through shared commitment to interrogating international law, state sovereignty, and structures of domination.

It is united by shared recognition that the current arrangement is catastrophic and that another world is both necessary and possible, never by dogma or organisation. This recognition itself constitutes the bond, an affinity based on refusal to accept injustice as inevitable.

### Two Interpretations Held in Productive Tension

How should we interpret the contemporary crisis? Derrida proposes two competing readings that cannot be collapsed into one:

**Interpretation One**: Even accepting liberal ideals (democracy, human rights, free markets) as valuable, the massive gap between ideal and reality demands indefinite Marxist critique to reduce that gap. We must work toward better realization of stated ideals while exposing their systematic violation.

**Interpretation Two**: The very concepts constituting liberal ideology (democracy, human rights, property, liberty, equality, fraternity, dignity, citizenship) must themselves be radically questioned and transformed. We cannot simply work toward better realization but must rethink the foundations.

Crucially, both interpretations are necessary. We cannot choose between them but must hold them in productive tension through "a complex and constantly re-evaluated strategy." Without this doubled approach, we risk either fatalist idealism (accepting ideals as eternal while acknowledging empirical failure) or abstract utopianism (proclaiming transformation without grounding in concrete struggle).

### "I Am Not a Marxist"

Derrida invokes Marx's famous statement, reported by Engels: "All I know is that I am not a Marxist." Even Marx refused Marxism, refused to be bound by the systems and dogmas claiming to derive from his work.

This refusal is fidelity to what is most valuable in Marx: the capacity for self-critique. "To continue to take inspiration from a certain spirit of Marxism would be to keep faith with what has always made of Marxism in principle and first of all a radical critique, namely a procedure ready to undertake its self-critique."

The essence of Marxism, properly understood, is its capacity for self-negation. Marx's method was to develop critique capable of constant revision, never to achieve final truth. Every stage of capitalism generates new contradictions requiring new analysis. The critique must evolve or become obsolete.

### The Emancipatory Promise Must Produce Effects

Derrida emphasises that the promise of emancipation must produce concrete effects: "A promise must promise to be kept, that is...to produce events, new effective forms of action, practice, organization, and so forth."

This guards against misreading deconstruction as merely textual or theoretical. Deconstruction has political consequences. It generates demands for practical transformation, for new forms of organization, for concrete resistance to injustice.

The "New International" must find ways to be effective (to coordinate action, to build solidarity, to resist domination) without reproducing party discipline, state power, or dogmatic certainty. This is extraordinarily difficult, but difficulty is not grounds for abandoning the task.

### The Messianic Structure and Infinite Critique

The theoretical key is preserving what Derrida calls "the messianic without messianism": the formal structure of promise, hope, and obligation without predetermined content.

We must affirm that another world is necessary and possible (the messianic affirmation) without claiming to know what that world will look like or how to achieve it with certainty (rejecting messianism). This requires committing to "radical and interminable, infinite (both theoretical and practical) critique."

The critique is radical (questioning fundamental assumptions, going beyond surface symptoms), interminable (never reaching completion or final truth), infinite (opening to an incalculable future), and both theoretical and practical (irreducible to either alone).

This critique "belongs to the movement of an experience open to the absolute future of what is coming, that is to say, a necessarily indeterminate, abstract, desert-like experience that is confided, exposed, given up to its waiting for the other and for the event."

The experience is "desert-like," stripped of predetermined content, waiting in darkness for what may come. This very openness is what makes genuine emancipatory thinking possible. If we knew the future in advance, we would not need to decide, to risk, to take responsibility. Decision is only possible through the ordeal of undecidability.

## Conclusion: Living with the Spectre

### The Return of the Repressed

Derrida's intervention accomplishes something crucial: it demonstrates that the attempt to exorcise Marx's spectre through triumphalist declarations of capitalism's final victory necessarily fails. The spectre returns precisely because what it represents (the possibility and necessity of radical critique, the promise of emancipation, the refusal to accept existing arrangements as inevitable) cannot be eliminated by ideological assertion.

Fukuyama's "end of history" and Kojève's post-historical fantasies are revealed as forms of denial proportional to the anxiety they attempt to suppress. The more insistently liberalism proclaims Marxism's death, the more it reveals that Marxist critique retains the power to articulate what liberal ideology cannot acknowledge about its own catastrophic consequences.

The ten plagues enumerated by Derrida (unemployment, exclusion, economic war, market contradictions, debt, arms trade, nuclear proliferation, ethnic violence, phantom-states, and inadequate international law) demonstrate that the world is in acute, potentially terminal crisis, never at history's end. The spectre of Marx returns with renewed urgency precisely because the suffering and injustice it names are multiplying, never diminishing.

### Fidelity Without Dogmatism

The most important achievement of Derrida's analysis is showing how to remain faithful to Marx's spirit without embracing Marxist dogmatism. By carefully distinguishing the spirit of radical critique and emancipatory promise from Marxist ontologies, methods, and apparatuses, Derrida opens a space for contemporary thought and action.

We can preserve the conviction that existing arrangements are contingent and never natural or inevitable, the insistence that radical critique of capitalism remains necessary, the affirmation that emancipation is both necessary and possible, and the commitment to infinite self-critique and openness to transformation. At the same time, we can reject dialectical materialism as systematic ontology, historical materialism as closed method, party discipline and state power as organisational forms, and teleological certainty about predetermined outcomes.

This is the only honest position for anyone taking both critique and responsibility seriously, never fence-sitting or tepid compromise. It requires holding in productive tension the need for concrete action and the recognition that the future cannot be calculated or controlled.

### The Task Ahead

The "New International" Derrida envisions is an opening, a way of naming the emerging solidarities based on shared recognition of catastrophe and shared commitment to imagining alternatives. It points toward forms of organization that remain to be invented, practices of resistance that must be continually reinvented, and ways of living together in pursuit of justice without certainty about outcomes.

The contemporary world faces the plagues Derrida identified and many others he could not have foreseen: ecological catastrophe accelerating beyond human control, surveillance capitalism penetrating ever deeper into subjective life, algorithmic governance replacing human decision-making, authoritarian resurgence across the globe, new forms of precarity and exploitation enabled by digital technology. The "New International" names the necessary ongoing work of critique, resistance, and emancipatory imagination.

### The Spectre's Final Lesson

What is the spectre of Marx ultimately? It is not a doctrine to be defended, not a system to be preserved, not a historical figure to be venerated. Rather, it is the insistence that time remains out of joint, that the present is always already disrupted by its relation to an incalculable future, that justice cannot be reduced to existing law, that emancipation remains a task we cannot abandon precisely because of our inability to guarantee its achievement.

To live with the spectre is to acknowledge that we are addressed by obligations we did not choose, by a past we did not make, by a future we cannot control. It is to recognize that responsibility persists even in the absence of certainty, that decision is only possible through the ordeal of undecidability, that action is required precisely when we lack guarantees about outcomes.

The spectre cannot be killed because it is the structure of temporality itself: the way the past persists in the present, the way the future already haunts what we call now, the way the present is never fully present to itself, always already disrupted, delayed, disjointed.

Fukuyama wanted to close the future by declaring history finished. Kojève wanted to bind the spectre to determinate ontology, to specify what post-historical man is and does. The spectre resists all such closures. It returns as the very opening of possibility that makes genuine politics thinkable.

In an age that insists there is no alternative, that claims history has reached its terminus, that proclaims the final victory of capitalism and liberal democracy, the spectre of Marx persists as a reminder that other worlds are both necessary and possible. The task is to remain faithful to the spirit of radical critique and emancipatory promise, to learn to live with the spectre, to accept what cannot die.

This is what Derrida means when he speaks of "a certain spirit of Marxism" worth preserving: a gesture, an opening, the courage to act despite uncertainty, the affirmation that justice demands we continue the struggle regardless of outcome. The spectre returns to remind us that the future remains radically open, that history is not finished, that emancipation remains our most urgent task.
